Welcome to the documentation for Smear Lab's Freely Moving Olfactory Navigation (FMON) behavioral rig.

This documentation includes a detailed explanation of the rig and the hardware and code that run it.

The rig's hardware is controlled by a [Bpod](bpod.qmd) state machine running in MATLAB and receiving realtime input from [Bonsai](bonsai.qmd). All data related to trial state is recorded by Bpod, while all analogue lectrical signals (e.g. sniff signal) are recorded by Bonsai.

The rig can be run either directly from the Bpod Console, or using a custom [GUI](gui.qmd) that was built with specific experiments in mind.
