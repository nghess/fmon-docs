title: "Data Acquisition"
---

At the end of each session, the [timeUp()](bpod.qmd#timeup) function stops Bpod and Bonsai, then executes [fmon_data_output.m](https://github.com/nghess/fmon-bpod/blob/main/fmon_data_output.m), a MATLAB script that saves and summarizes the recently acquired data.

The data output script handles copying and saving Bpod session data, NiDAQ data, and video files. Additionally, the script creates a summary of session information and mouse performance, then saves and displays it as a text file.

These data are all saved in the appropriate directory. Directories are organized by mouse ID, session type, and session number. For example, data for Mouse 1234, 100-0 task, session 5, will be saved to D:/fmon_data/1234/100-0/5/

## Saved Data
In each session folder you will find:

* BpodSessionData.mat
    + Data recorded by Bpod and stored as a MATLAB struct. Includes detailed timing data for state changes and trial events.
* NiDAQ_poke.dat
    + Binary data file containing voltages for left, (ch1) right, (ch2) and initiation reward (ch3) ports.
* NiDAQ_sniff.dat
    + Binary data file containing voltages from thermistor (ch1) camera TTL trigger (ch2) and left (ch3) and right (ch4) final valves.
* notes.txt
    + Summary file generated at the end of each session. Contains session information, mouse performance, and (optional) experimenter notes.
* rawvideo.txt
    + Bonsai timestamps of for each video frame captured.
* rawvideo202x-xx-xxTxx_xx_xx.avi
    + Raw video file captured by Bonsai.

## Data Processing
Prior to analysis, data from Bonsai and Bpod must be processed and temporally aligned. I've broken the pipeline into a series of functions, which can be executed in order using [fmon_data_builder.m](https://github.com/nghess/fmon-bpod/blob/main/data_scripts/fmon_data_builder.m) then visualized with [fmon_data_visualize.m](https://github.com/nghess/fmon-bpod/blob/main/data_scripts/fmon_data_visualize.m). An example visualization is shown below.
